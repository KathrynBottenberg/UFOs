# UFOs
## Overview:
  The purpose of this project was to help a client improve the search engine of their UFO website to have more filters available for their users. The original website was already up and runnning with a intro paragraph, search tool by date of a UFO sighting and a table of information. The client tasked us with adding in additional filters: City, State, Country, and Shape. We modified the clients javascript code (app.js) as well as their html code (index.html) to provide the requested results.
